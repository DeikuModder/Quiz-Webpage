### QUIZ PAGE VANILLA JS

Hello there! So yesterday i've decided to test myself and make a quiz page with vanilla javascript, html, and css, no tutorials, all with my knowledges, and i've done it! It's very simple and it uses recursion to render the questions 

### Documentation

In this case there's no specific documentation, although i used Mozilla Dev, and CDN documentation on something about the DOM

### Features

It doesn't have any client side features, but i've made the code in a way you can scale it by adding as many questions as you want (even make a system to create more questions on the page as well), make an award system with the scores, a lot ot of options that could be implemented

### NOTES

Now, i know the CSS it's pretty messy, but the point of this little project was for me to practice my JS and DOM manipulation knowledges, rather than my design and CSS skills, so i only made it available on Desktop and Tablet devices, cause i wont make the responsive design for the mobile

Didn't deploy using gh pages cause this project as i said it's just to test my skills in js
